- <b>[Algorithms](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Algorithms)</b>
  - [Rubiks Cube Solver](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Algorithms/blob/main/RubiksSolver)
    - Algorithm to solve any scrambled configuration of a rubiks cube.
   
  - [Towers of Hanoi](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Algorithms/blob/main/TowersOfHanoi/)
    - This C program provides a solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem, employing recursive techniques for efficient disk movement between pegs. Users can specify the number of disks and the source and destination pegs through command-line arguments. The program performs basic input validation to ensure the correctness of input parameters. It outputs the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, displaying each move along with the source and destination pegs. Upon completion, the program exits gracefully.


- <b>[Full-Stack](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Full-Stack)</b>
  - [Online Recipe Forum](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Full-Stack/tree/main/OnlineRecipeForum)
    - Developed a full-stack web application that allows users to register, log in, and browse recipes.

   - [Kitchen Simulator](https://github.com/rackman404/Terrahacks-2024-Project)  
    - Users can drag and drop kitchen items such as a fridge, sink, cabinet, and stove onto a grid layout. Additional functionality includes managing food items within the fridge and cabinet, displaying and removing food items, and a modal for adding new food items.
   
  
- <b>[Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/EmbeddedSystems)</b>
  - [EEBot Maze Navigation](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/EmbeddedSystems/tree/main/EEBotMazeNavigation)
    - Developed a path-finding program for the EEBot using assembly language on the HCS12 microcontroller.

  - [State Machine](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/EmbeddedSystems/blob/main/StateMachine/)
    - This C program simulates a state machine with dynamic state management and garbage collection capabilities. Users can define state transitions, modify state configurations, and perform garbage collection to clean up unused states. The simulator provides a command-line interface for interaction and supports features like state transition verification, garbage collection, and state deletion. Additionally, it offers functionalities to view state transitions, perform data manipulation, and exit the program gracefully.

- <b>[Software Development](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev)</b>
  - [Bank Account Application](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev/blob/main/BankAccountApplication/)
    - The code repository contains Java classes designed for bank account management. The Account class is responsible for functionalities such as deposit and withdrawal, ensuring proper balance management. On the other hand, the Bank class oversees multiple accounts, guaranteeing unique account numbers to maintain data integrity and security.
  - [BlackJack Game](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev/tree/main/BlackJack%20Game)
    - The code implements a Java Blackjack game with card and UI classes, utilizing ArrayLists.
  - [Virtual Circuit Builder](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev/tree/main/Circuit%20Builder)
    - Reads command lines from user and accordingly performs the necessary operations to build a virtual circuit.
  - [Flight Booking Manager](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev/tree/main/FlightBooking)
    - Provides an interface to allow users to manage a Flight bookings.
  - [Odometer](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/SoftDev/tree/main/Odometer)
    - Creates a decimal digit counter simulating an Odometer.

- <b>[C](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/C)</b>
  - [Diabetic Population Data Manipulation](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/C/blob/main/DiabeticPopulationDataManipulation/)
    - The C program processes diabetes statistics from a CSV file, calculating and presenting averages, extremes, and status comparisons for provinces and national data. It also generates CSV files for date and age-wise data visualization.
  
- <b>[Bash](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Bash)</b>
  - [MacOS Live Dashboard](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Bash/tree/main/DesktopDashboard)
    - Developed a real-time system monitoring dashboard on macOS using Bash scripts, updating live every second.
  - [MacOS Customized Terminal](https://github.com/MustansirVerdawala/Bash/tree/main/TerminalCustomization)
    - Developed a custom terminal setup using tmux to manage multiple panes with automated script executions.
